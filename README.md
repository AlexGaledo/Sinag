**Sinag** is a comprehensive electricity consumption management platform that transforms utility data into actionable and incentivized climate action. Instead of requiring IoT sensors, Sinag functions as a Smart Tracker that analyzes users’ historical Meralco billing data. An Artificial Intelligence model determines each household’s baseline electricity usage and calculates the difference between this baseline and current consumption to measure verified energy savings. These savings are then converted into **Sinag Tokens**, the platform’s digital currency, with all transactions recorded on a blockchain ledger to ensure trust, transparency, and data security.
